INSERTION SORTER EXPLANATION
=========================

CLASS InsertionSorter:
    // This is a utility class that provides a method to sort arrays
    // It uses the insertion sort algorithm, which works like sorting playing cards in your hand

    /**
     * Sorts any array whose elements can be compared (they must implement Comparable)
     * For example: Book objects that can be compared by title
     */
    METHOD sort(arr: Array of T where T implements Comparable):
        // If array is null or has 0-1 elements, no need to sort
        IF arr IS NULL OR arr.length < 2 THEN:
            RETURN  // Nothing to do

        // Start from the second element (index 1)
        // Because a single element is already sorted
        FOR i = 1 TO arr.length - 1:
            // Take the current element as the key to insert
            key = arr[i]
            
            // Start comparing with previous elements
            j = i - 1
            
            // Keep moving elements forward if they're greater than key
            WHILE j >= 0 AND arr[j] > key:
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]    // Shift this element forward
                j = j - 1              // Move to previous element
            
            // Found the right spot, insert the key here
            arr[j + 1] = key

END CLASS

EXPLANATION OF HOW INSERTION SORT WORKS:
-------------------------------------
Imagine you're sorting playing cards in your hand:

1. Start with an unsorted deck of cards
   [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]

2. Take one card at a time (starting with the second card)
   First pass: [5 | 2, 4, 1, 3]
   - Compare 2 with 5
   - 2 is smaller, so move 5 forward and put 2 in front
   Result: [2, 5 | 4, 1, 3]

3. Take the next card
   Second pass: [2, 5 | 4, 1, 3]
   - Compare 4 with 5, move 5 forward
   - Compare 4 with 2, 4 is larger
   - Put 4 after 2
   Result: [2, 4, 5 | 1, 3]

4. Continue until all cards are sorted
   Final result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

USAGE EXAMPLE:
------------
// To sort an array of books by title:
books = [Book("Zebra", 1), Book("Apple", 2), Book("Cat", 3)]
InsertionSorter.sort(books)
// Result: [Book("Apple", 2), Book("Cat", 3), Book("Zebra", 1)]

NOTE: This sorting method is:
- Simple to understand and implement
- Good for small arrays
- Stable (keeps same-value items in their original order)
- In-place (doesn't need extra space)
